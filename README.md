# Installation:

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoyVanBeek/tools/master/install.sh | sh
```

Installs some very handy tools:

- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): syntax highlighting cat replacement.
- [Prettyping](http://denilson.sa.nom.br/prettyping/): Fancy, visual ping replacement
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): ctrl-R replacement
- [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) Better git diff

But also sets up git with some options like to rebase by default, enable rerere, git prompt to summarize status and show branch name etc.

Also installs a set of apt and pip packages I often use.
